Progress I've made in 2020 towards improving my sleep duration and quality.

{% newthought 'I have struggled with sleep now for the better part of a decade.'%} I think it started in high school, where I was caught up in a culture of minimizing the importance of sleep. It wasn't uncommon to stay up late (well past 1 AM) "proving" how dedicated you were to studying. My school tried to combat this by implementing access controls to internet, which were easily circumvented with a VPN. It was not at all unusual to pull all-nighters, and have your roommate begrudgingly attest to your scholarliness the next day at lunch. These habits followed me into college, where I found it impossible to put my mind to rest when it was time to sleep. Over the years, I started developing pretty severe anxiety around sleep. I knew it would take me 1, 2, sometimes 3 hours to actually fall asleep after I went to bed. Knowing there was no way I'd wake up feeling refreshed the following morning would in turn make me anxious about getting done everything I needed to do the following day. Later I started my career at a workplace with pretty intense hours; it wasn't uncommong to get home after 11pm or midnight on a weekday. Again, I found it difficult to balance this with the need to decompress after work while also juggling the anxiety of knowing I wouldn't be able to perform at my best the next day.

By late 2019 I was fed up, and some non-sleep related health issues forced me to evaluate what I could do to change my relationship with sleep. Below I outline what I've tried so far and how those approaches have worked out.

## Sleep Apnea
Having been told I was a snorer, I signed up for an overnight sleep study at a clinic. Following the study I was diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea, with an AHI {% sidenote 1 'AHI stands for Apnea-Hypopnea Index, which measures the number of times your breathing pauses for >10 seconds during sleep. Apnea events often result in brief arousals, breaking the continuity of sleep' %} of 17. I was prescribed a CPAP {% sidenote 2 'CPAP stands for continuous positive airway pressure' %} machine, which I've used nightly ever since. The CPAP forces air through my nose at a pressure level that automatically adjusts to my breathing throughout the night. 

Although I've been on this course of treatment for nearly twelve months as I write this, I can't say it's been particularly effective at improving the quality or duration of my sleep. I think a part of this may have to do with the fact that CPAP alone didn't really address my sleep anxiety, which is the biggest driver of sleep duration, which in turn 

## Set and Setting
To borrow a catchphrase from Timothy Leary, pre-sleep mind*set* and the setting in which I go to sleep contain important variables.


This is a test line change.
