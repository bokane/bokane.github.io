Some mental models I've used to hack habit formation.

{% newthought 'I have come to fervently believe in the power of small changes.'%} Starting my career in the financial sphere, especially fixed income, I've long had an appreciation for the power of compounding interest. The gist is that as you earn interest on some initial principal amount, over time the interest earns interest too, causing the value of your investment (or debt!) to snowball. At even low nominal interest rates, frequent compounding results in huge long term returns.

Even though I understood this concept intellectually, in practice I haven't done a great job applying it outside my career and personal finances. Rather than focus on an easy 1% improvement, I've tended to swing for a much harder 10-20% improvement. Changing your habits is **hard**, and aiming for ambitious outcomes tends to result in failure the majority of the time for me. This results in discouragement and anxiety from failure, which in turn makes me less likely to try again. For a concrete example, several months into the pandemic I noticed I was almost completely sedentary. I would go days without going outside, meaning my only physical activity was going from room to room. To remedy this, I told myself I would start jogging every day for at least 20 minutes. The next morning I get up, lace up my shoes, and hit the pavement. After maybe 5 minutes I'm out of breath and discouraged. I walk home dejected, and can't help but stress about the failure for the rest of the day.

Enter tiny habits{% sidenote 1 'NPR&#8217;s Life Kit has a great episode on tiny habits [here](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/25/809256398/tiny-habits-are-the-key-to-behavioral-change).' %}. The three key principles are:
1.  (1) Find the smallest version of the habit you want to build toward
2.  (2) Find a natural cue to start the habit (could be a time, place etc.)
3.  (3) Intentionally celebrate success, e.g. using words of affirmation. As silly as it sounds, this step is absolutely critical.

Rather than tell myself I'm going to jog for 20 minutes every day, I say I'm going to walk around the block just once. Once I've taken the first few steps, I start the mental rewards. The idea is to mimic the neural reward system from videogames - the blinking lights, "You Won!" signs etc. which make you want to continue playing. So I fist-pump in the air, give myself positive words of affirmation, and keep going. This approach, unlike the ambitious 20 minute daily jog, is very successful. I find myself excited to wake up and immediately go for a walk in the morning. Virtually every time I go out I end up walking much, much longer than a single block. Even though walking is less impactful than jogging or running from a relative perspective, it's far more effective on an absolute scale than being ambitious and failing. These improvements also compound over time - I derive happiness from completing the tiny habit, which reinforces my motivation to get up and do it again the next time. 

One difficulty I've observed, which I'd love feedback on, is maintaining these tiny habits after disruptions to cues. Maybe my sleep schedule changes, or I have to do something other than walk immediately when I get out of bed which is my normal cue for the walking tiny habit. It's been really difficult, though not impossible, for me to resume habits when this cue relationship breaks down.

In another post I'm going to talk about how I've applied tiny habits and an experimental approach to hacking my sleep - something I've struggled with for going on a decade.
