Toward a year focused on doing more and consuming less. WORK IN PROGRESS.
<!--more-->

This year my "resolution" is to challenge myself to a series of projects. The emphasis of this challenge will be addressing  

[REST OF PREAMBLE]

So without further ado, the list:

Objective: Perform in an improv comedy show
Motivation: I am really bad a failing in front of other people - I can’t think of a better form of exposure therapy than making a fool of myself on stage in front of strangers. . I also want to improve my public speaking skills and my willingness to feel vulnerable talking in front of groups. I’ve come to realize I often have ideas that I don’t vocalize because I’m worried I haven’t thought them through yet.

This is also partially inspired by attending a wonderful improv/stand-up show called “Email Pro” hosted by Ivan at The Tank. If you’re interested, I’ll cover your ticket and go with you. 

Objective: Start a blog, and write then edit at least 4 posts \\ 
Motivation: Really just an excuse to write more, which is something I haven’t done a lot of since college. The editing part is important to me because I’ve never spent a as much time as I should have revising and improving upon first drafts. A lot of people don’t know this because I have a pretty good track record of meeting deadlines, but I’m actually a chronic procrastinator. A lot of the “editing” takes place as I iterate through ideas while procrastinating before ultimately finishing a task, rather than iterating through real drafts. I want to practice getting in the habit of setting deadlines and editing before I reach them. If you’re reading this, I’m over 1/4 of the way through this challenge!

Objective: Implement, backtest, paper trade (and optionally, actually trade) an algorithmic strategy

Motivation: I’ve been meaning to do this since taking [course with Phelan] at Williams. It’s a good way to develop my programming and quant finance skills with a real world application, motivated by the potential of an actual payout. I’ve toying with a few leveraged ETF strategies - maybe the subject of a future post. [footnote on spending money to learn etc]

Objective: Reach out to 7x people I don’t interact with on a regular basis each month.
Motivation: 

Objective: play at least one squash match (6 games) per month
Motivation: Over the past few years I’ve made many start and stop attempts at incorporating a regular fitness routine. These have included strong lifts, couch to 5k, HIIT, and a personal trainer. I’ve developed a theory that part of the reason I’ve failed to nurture these attempts into something stable is because I’ve been avoiding disincentives rather than pursuing a positive incentive. For example, “I am exercising because I need to avoid bad side effect X of not being fit” rather than “I am exercising because I’m working toward goal Y.” 

Objective: Schedule stuff with people 
Motivation: People inviting me vs me taking initiative; footnote about women performing emotional labor.

Reach Goal: Flight lessons
Motivation:
