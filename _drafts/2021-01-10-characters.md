Chinese characters 
<!--more-->

Ever since I saw this character a few weeks ago, I've been obsessed with thinking about how new characters are constructed. Somehow in 6+ years of formal Mandarin education, it had never occurred to me until now what the process looks like to create new characters. Many words for modern phenomena are the syntheses of existing characters. For example, the Mandarin word for computer (dian4nao3 电脑) is the combination of the words for 'electricity' (电) and 'brain' (脑).
