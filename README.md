# Bo Kane's blog

This is my blog infrastructure, hosted via Pages served to ```bokane.net```. I adapted the *Tufte-Jekyll* blog theme from the Github repository by Clay Harmon [here](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll), which is turn based on a CSS [repository](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) in the style of Edward Tufte, author of *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*.

I compile the site locally using Docker's official Jekyll image.
