# Blog

This is my blog infrastructure, hosted via Github Pages to ```bokane.net```. I compile the site locally using Docker's official Jekyll image. I adapted the *Tufte-Jekyll* blog theme from the Github repository by Clay Harmon [here](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll), which is in turn based on a CSS [repository](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) in the styling of Edward Tufte (author of *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*).
